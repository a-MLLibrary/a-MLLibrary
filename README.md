For the scripts Python 3.6.4 was used.
See the example usage of the library in the examples/run\_library.py file

To change the parameters of the algorithms, use configuration\_file/parameters.ini file. parameters\_analtyical.ini is used for the hybrid analyses with fixed hyper-parameters. In run\_library.file, the data sizes and number of cores for the train and test sets are setted.

You can run the example file by the following command:
	python run_library.py

To just use the library run (for seed provide a number):
	python run.py seed -i "input_file_path" -c "configuration_file_path"
